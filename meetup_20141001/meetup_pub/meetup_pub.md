There are Meetup groups for several different activities ([running](http://www.meetup.com/ncroadrunners/), [cooking](http://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Cooks/), [playing the piano](http://www.meetup.com/Relax-and-Play-in-the-Triangle/), [learning natural languages](http://www.meetup.com/raleigh-portuguese/), [paleo lifestyle](http://www.meetup.com/Paleo-in-Raleigh/)).

I will concentrate on Meetups related to software development.

Some of them are more related to programming. Others are related to software development process and management, DevOps, etc.

>> Not a new idea? [Users' Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Users%27_group)?

# Types of Meetups 

The actual "offline" meetings:

- Talks
  - Lightning  Talks
- Hack Sessions
- "Meals" (breakfast, lunch)

I have only been to Talks and Lightning Talks.


--- 

# Talks

## Structure:

- [Optional] Food and Drinks (and Networking)
- Announcements (job offers, job requests, other events, ...) [1-10min]
- Talk [45-120min]
- Q&A after the talk [1-10min]
- [Optional] Giveaways [1-10min]
- [Optional] Additional announcements [1-5 min]
- Time for Networking

> Lightning talks have the same structure, except that instead of one talk, it consists of several 5-10 minute talks.


---

## Location:

Usually: 

- Dining hall, conference room 
- Usually in a company: Quintiles, WebAssign, Cognitec, MetLife, RedHat, Ipreo, ...
- Space for 30-100 participants

## Date and Time

Usually: 

- Monday to Thursday
- Start: 6 to 7PM

---

# Meals

- Agile Coaches Breakfast http://www.meetup.com/RTP-ALN-Chapter/events/199420272/

---

# Hack Sessions

- Hack Night http://www.meetup.com/nscoderrtp/events/209239302/


---

## Observations

- Software developers must "stay informed,maintain relationships, and keep their domain knowledge up to date"
- Professionals go to these Meetups after a day of work. They probably find some value in them.
 - Which is the value?
  - Mostly networking?

  
---

# Hypotheses

- Meetups allow more flexibility regarding time than conference talks
- Meetups allow more Q&A during and after the talk than conference talks
- Meetups promote unexpected learning
- Meetups promote Reflective Practice (later)

## Reflective Practice

- Definition: the capacity to reflect on action so as to engage in a process of continuous learning (Schön, 1983) 

- "Individuals *learning* from their own *professional experiences* rather than from *formal teaching*"
 - May be the most important source of professional development and improvement
 
- practice-based professional learning

- Schön 1983, Dewey 1933, ..., Marcus Aurelius
